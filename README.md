# Rebels in the Sky

![Splash screen](demo/demo.gif)

It's the year 2101. Corporations have taken over the world.
The only way to be free is to join a pirate crew and start plundering the galaxy. The only mean of survival is to play basketball.

Now it's your turn to go out there and make a name for yourself. Create your crew and start wondering the galaxy in search of worthy basketball opponents.

## Just try it out!

`ssh rebels.frittura.org -p 2222`

Connect via SSH to try the game. Only local game is available and there is no mouse support nor music :(

</details>

#### Arch Linux

`rebels-in-the-sky` can be installed from the [official repositories](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/rebels-in-the-sky/):

```sh
pacman -S rebels-in-the-sky
```

## Build

You need to have the rust toolchain installed --> https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install. Then you can build the game with

`cargo build --release`

## Run

This game runs as a terminal application, meaning that you just need to run the executable from your terminal with

`./rebels`

If you downloaded the binaries, you will first need to give execution permissions to the executable with

`chmod +x rebels`

Suggested minimal terminal size: 160x48. Not all terminals support the game colors nicely, so you might need to try different ones. Here is a list of tested terminals:

-   Linux: whatever the default terminal is, it should work
-   MacOs: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/), [tabby](https://tabby.sh/)
-   Windows: [tabby](https://tabby.sh/)

**Important**: currently local bot teams are generated by default to make the game more enjoyable. This behaviour can be disabled by passing the `-f` flag to the executable. In the future, when more players will be available, the game will default to online teams only.
